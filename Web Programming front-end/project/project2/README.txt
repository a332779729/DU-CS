This web named Golden Gate Canyon State Park
It introduce the "Golden Gate Canyon State Park". I just visit there on this weekend. It is beautiful park in Colorado.


In this website, I use 3 parts to introduce the Golden Gate Canyon State Park.
The first page is "Home" that is just introduce what is "Golden Gate Canyon State Park". In this page, I use some picture and description to decrible this state park.
Also, I create the navigation to link to other pages, and to create the footer in page. I use description for outdoor and the table show their distance and degree of difficulty.

The second page is "Outdoor" that introduce the 3 plainning in this state park we can do, and how to join it. Visiters can write their name, email, age, gender, and liked plainning in this page.
In this page the users also can use navigation to come back any others pages.

The third page is "Trails" that introduce trail in this states park, and every trails line's ditails in this state park. Also, I create the park's map that is PDF file in this page.

I used the <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <nav> and <footer> in every page. I putted different pictures by <img> in every page. I used <table> to introduce every trail line in Home page.
Also, I used <ul>, <ol>, and <dl> to let the introductions look very hierarchical in my pages. I uesd <form>, <fieldset>, and <input> to let user join plannings in the Outdoor page.



For project2
I add javascript css to every pages. I have added the nav element's css, it will change the location color at between on mouse over and mouse out. I also add the button to change the pictures. 
I add the "dark" and "light" button to fit user read page on night or day. For the Home page, I add the change color on title. I have added different pictures and change the their shape. 
For the Trails page, the all pictures can be change to other ones when the mouse on the picture. I used text box to let the page is smaller. For the Outdoor page, I add the google map on my page.(from the google map website) User can check their information.
