--Write a function firstAnswer :: ( a -> Maybe b ) -> [a] -> Maybe b.
--Notice the arguments are curried. The first argument should be applied to elements of the second argument (a list) in order until the first time it returns Just v for some v and then Just v is the result of the call to firstAnswer.
--If the first argument returns Nothing for all the elements in the list, then firstAnswer should return Nothing.
--Note, the solution isn't long and doesn't do anything fancy so don't overthink it. Also, the function that's passed can be thought of as a predicate (see its signature?).
--It returns Nothing or Just v for particular types of a if it determines those are invalid or valid answers.
--Note: The description of this has changed slightly to return Nothing instead of an error if there aren't any matches.

--The first argument should be applied to elements of the second argument.

--Otherwise, calls to the first argument will have produced Just lst1, Just lst2, ..., Just lstn and the result of allAnswers is Just lst, where lst is [lst1, lst2, ..., lstn].

--Write a function match that takes a (Value, Pattern) and returns a Maybe [(String, Value)] (note the list is inside the Maybe type, it's not a list of Maybe types).

--Hints: The solution has one case expression with 7 branches (that's a pretty big hint...). The branch in particular for tuples uses allAnswers and Data.List.zip.
