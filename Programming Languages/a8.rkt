;;module A8 where
;;Write a function, squareSum, which takes a non-negative integer n and returns the sum of the squares of all integers 0 through n.
;;Your function need not behave well on inputs less than zero.

;;This function named squareSum, and this function can square all element that smaller than the number user entered and sum. It is return the number of sum.

;;Write a function, cycleOne, which takes a list and returns a list which is the same as the input parameter list but with the first element of the list moved to the end.
;;For example, cycleOne '(1 2 3 4) should produce '(2 3 4 1).

;;This function named cycleOne, and this function can get a list and let the first element move to last in the list. It is return the list.
;;type: list

;;Write a function, cycleN that takes two parameters, count and a list, and produces the same list but with the first element cycled to the end of the list count number of times.
;;For example: cycleN 2 '(1 2 3 4) should produce '(3 4 1 2) and cycleN 0 '(1 2 3 4) should produce '(1 2 3 4) and cycleN 4 '(1 2 3 4) should also produce '(1 2 3 4).

;;Write a function, memberOf?, which takes a value and a list of values. The function returns true if the list contains the value and false otherwise.
;;Use the equal? predicate to determine whether two values are equal or not.

;;This function named memberOf?, and this function can check if the number is in the list, and this fuction do it n times. It is return the boolean.

;;Write a function, intersection, which takes two lists as parameters and produces a new list which is the intersection of the values in the lists.
;;You should use the memberOf? function from the previous problem.

;;This function named intersection, and this function can check if both lists have the same elements, and it will return the same element to a new list.
